					<h3>Front-end Developer</h3>
					<hr class="hr-gradient">
					<p>I have always been wanting to establish a career in IT particularly in the web development side. Last October 2012, I was lucky enough to get a TESDA-sponsored scholarship to study a short course in web development at Informatics. After then, I have been doing self-study to further my learning and have been developing locally while working fulltime. So here I am putting together all that I have learned and created cryzero.com</p>
